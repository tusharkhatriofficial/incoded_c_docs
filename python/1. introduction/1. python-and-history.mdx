# Intro to Python and it's history.

## Python and How It Started

Python is like a recipe for computers. A person named Guido van Rossum cooked it up and shared it with the world in 1991. He got the idea for Python during his Christmas holidays in 1989. Just like when you get inspired to create something cool while you're on a break.

He wanted to make a language that was easy to read and write, kind of like how you talk or write your thoughts. That's why it's called Python—named after a comedy group he liked.
