# Types of Functions in C

## Overview

In C programming, functions can be categorized into different types based on their behavior and purpose. Understanding these types of functions is essential for writing efficient and modular code. This documentation provides a description of the different types of functions in C, including void functions, value returning functions, and library functions.

## Void Functions

**Void functions** are functions that do not return a value. They are used when a function only needs to perform a specific task without providing any output. Void functions are defined with a return type of `void`.

```c
void function_name(parameter_list) {
    // Function body
    // Code to be executed
}
```

Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void greet() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

int main() {
    greet(); // Calling the greet function
    return 0;
}
```

- The `greet` function is a void function because it does not return any value.
- Inside the function body, we use the `printf` function to display the greeting message.
- In the `main` function, we call the `greet` function, which prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Value Returning Functions

**Value returning functions** are functions that return a value after performing a specific task. They are used when a function needs to compute a result and provide it as output to the caller. Value returning functions are defined with a return type other than `void`.

```c
return_type function_name(parameter_list) {
    // Function body
    // Code to be executed
    // return statement
}
```

Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int square(int num) {
    return num * num;
}

int main() {
    int number = 5;
    int result = square(number);
    printf("The square of %d is: %d\n", number, result);
    return 0;
}
```

- The `square` function is a value returning function because it returns an integer value.
- Inside the function body, we multiply the `num` parameter by itself and use the `return` statement to send the result back to the caller.
- In the `main` function, we declare a variable `number` and assign it the value `5`.
- We call the `square` function with `number` as the argument and store the result in the `result` variable.
- Finally, we print the value of `result`, which displays the square of `5`.

## Library Functions

**Library functions** are functions that are already provided by C libraries and can be used in your programs without having to define them yourself. These functions cover a wide range of tasks and are designed to be reusable across different programs. To use library functions, you need to include the appropriate header file that contains the function declaration.

Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n"); // Using the printf library function
    return 0;
}
```

- The `printf` function is a library function from the `stdio.h` library.
- It is used to print formatted output to the console.
- In the `main` function, we call the `printf` function to display the "Hello, World!" message.

In this documentation, you learned about the different types of functions in C: void functions, value returning functions, and library functions. 

- Void functions are used when a function does not need to return a value.

- Value returning functions compute a result and provide it as output.

- Library functions are pre-defined functions provided by C libraries. 

By understanding the purpose and behaviour of each function type, you can choose
the appropriate type for different tasks in your C programs.
