# C Structures

C structures are user-defined data types that allow you to group related data elements of different types into a single unit. Structures provide a way to organize and represent complex data structures in C programs. They are widely used for modeling real-world entities and organizing data efficiently.

## Declaring and Defining a Structure

To declare a structure, you use the `struct` keyword followed by the structure name. Inside the structure, you define the individual members and their data types. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Structure declaration
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float grade;
};

int main() {
    // Structure variable declaration
    struct Student student1;

    // Accessing structure members
    strcpy(student1.name, "John");
    student1.age = 20;
    student1.grade = 85.5;

    // Printing structure members
    printf("Name: %s\n", student1.name);
    printf("Age: %d\n", student1.age);
    printf("Grade: %.2f\n", student1.grade);

    return 0;
}
```

```zsh
Name: John
Age: 20
Grade: 85.50
```

- In the above code, we declare a structure `Student` with three members: `name` (character array), `age` (integer), and `grade` (float).
- Inside the `main()` function, we declare a structure variable `student1` of type `struct Student`.
- We access and modify the structure members using the dot (`.`) operator.
- Finally, we print the structure members using `printf()`.

## Initializing Structure Variables

Structure variables can be initialized at the time of declaration using curly braces `{}`. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() {
    // Structure variable initialization
    struct Point p = {10, 20};

    // Accessing structure members
    printf("x: %d\n", p.x);
    printf("y: %d\n", p.y);

    return 0;
}
```

```zsh
x: 10
y: 20
```

- In the above code, we declare a structure `Point` with two members: `x` and `y`, both of type `int`.
- We initialize the structure variable `p` with values `{10, 20}` at the time of declaration.
- We access and print the structure members using `printf()`.

## Accessing Structure Members

To access structure members, you use the dot (`.`) operator. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Rectangle {
    int length;
    int width;
};

int main() {
    struct Rectangle rect;

    // Accessing structure members
    rect.length = 10;
    rect.width = 5;

    // Calculating area
    int area = rect.length * rect.width;

    printf("Length: %d\n", rect.length);
    printf("Width: %d\n", rect.width);
    printf("Area: %d\n", area);

    return 0;
}
```


```zsh
Length: 10
Width: 5
Area: 50
```

- In the above code, we declare a structure `Rectangle` with two members: `length` and `width`, both of type `int`.
- We declare a structure variable `rect` of type `struct Rectangle`.
- We access and modify the structure members `length` and `width` using the dot (`.`) operator.
- We calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width` members.
- Finally, we print the structure members and the calculated area using `printf()`.

## Nesting Structures

In C, structures can be nested inside other structures as members. This allows for creating more complex data structures. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Address {
    char street[50];
    char city[50];
    char state[20];
    int zip;
};

struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    struct Address address;  // Nested structure
};

int main() {
    struct Person person;

    // Accessing nested structure members
    strcpy(person.name, "John");
    person.age = 25;
    strcpy(person.address.street, "123 Main Street");
    strcpy(person.address.city, "New York");
    strcpy(person.address.state, "NY");
    person.address.zip = 10001;

    // Printing structure members
    printf("Name: %s\n", person.name);
    printf("Age: %d\n", person.age);
    printf("Street: %s\n", person.address.street);
    printf("City: %s\n", person.address.city);
    printf("State: %s\n", person.address.state);
    printf("ZIP: %d\n", person.address.zip);

    return 0;
}
```

```zsh
Name: John
Age: 25
Street: 123 Main Street
City: New York
State: NY
ZIP: 10001
```

- In the above code, we define two structures: `Address` and `Person`.
- The `Address` structure has members for `street`, `city`, `state`, and `zip`.
- The `Person` structure has members for `name`, `age`, and an embedded structure `address` of type `Address`.
- We declare a structure variable `person` of type `struct Person`.
- We access and modify the structure members using the dot (`.`) operator, both for the top-level and nested structures.
- Finally, we print the structure members using `printf()`.

## Array of Structures

In C, you can create arrays of structures, allowing you to store multiple instances of a structure in a contiguous block of memory. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Employee {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float salary;
};

int main() {
    struct Employee employees[3];

    // Input employee details
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("Enter details for employee %d:\n", i + 1);

        printf("Name: ");
        scanf("%s", employees[i].name);

        printf("Age: ");
        scanf("%d", &employees[i].age);

        printf("Salary: ");
        scanf("%f", &employees[i].salary);
    }

    // Display employee details
    printf("\nEmployee Details:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("Employee %d\n", i + 1);
        printf("Name: %s\n", employees[i].name);
        printf("Age: %d\n", employees[i].age);
        printf("Salary: %.2f\n\n", employees[i].salary);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

- In the above code, we define a structure `Employee` with members for `name`, `age`, and `salary`.
- We create an array of `Employee` structures named `employees` with a size of 3.
- Using a loop, we input the details of each employee from the user.
- We access and modify the structure members of each employee using the dot (`.`) operator.
- After inputting the details, we display the employee details using another loop.

## Structure Size and Memory Alignment

The size of a structure in C may not be equal to the sum of the sizes of its members due to padding and memory alignment. The `sizeof` operator can be used to determine the size of a structure. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Example {
    char c;
    int i;
    double d;
};

int main() {
    struct Example ex;

    printf("Size of structure: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(ex));

    return 0;
}
```

```zsh
Size of structure: 24 bytes
```

- In the above code, we define a structure `Example` with members of different data types: `char`, `int`, and `double`.
- We declare a structure variable `ex` of type `struct Example`.
- We use the `sizeof` operator to determine the size of the structure in bytes and print it using `printf()`.

## Structure Examples and Use Cases

Structures are widely used to model real-world entities and organize related data efficiently. Some common use cases for structures include:

- Storing and manipulating data related to students, employees, or any other entity with multiple attributes.
- Representing geometric shapes, where each structure member holds information about a specific attribute (e.g., length, width, area).
- Creating a database record structure that contains various fields (e.g., name, age, address) for storing information in a tabular format.
- Building complex data structures like linked lists, stacks, or queues using structures to define the individual nodes or elements.

Structures provide a flexible and powerful way to work with data in C, allowing you to organize and manipulate complex information effectively.
