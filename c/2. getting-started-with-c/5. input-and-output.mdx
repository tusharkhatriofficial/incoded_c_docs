# Input/Output

Input and output (I/O) are essential aspects of programming, including C. C provides several standard library functions for performing I/O operations, such as reading input from the user, printing output to the console, and working with files.



## Input in C:

In C programming, the `scanf()` function is used to read input from the user. The syntax of `scanf()` function is as follows:

```c
scanf(format, &variable1, &variable2, ...);
```

The `format` argument specifies the data type of the input. The `&` operator is used to pass the address of the variable where the input will be stored. Here's an example that shows how to use `scanf()` function to read input from the user:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;
    
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    
    printf("You entered: %d", num);
    
    return 0;
}
```

```c
Enter a number: 10
You entered: 10
```



## Output in C:

In C programming, the `printf()` function is used to print output to the console. The syntax of `printf()` function is as follows:

```c
printf(format, variable1, variable2, ...);
```

The `format` argument specifies the format of the output. The `%` character is used to specify placeholders for variables, and the format specifier follows the `%` character. Here's an example that shows how to use `printf()` function to print output to the console:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    float f = 3.14;
    char c = 'a';
    
    printf("Integer: %d\n", num);
    printf("Float: %f\n", f);
    printf("Character: %c\n", c);
    
    return 0;
}
```

```c
Integer: 10
Float: 3.140000
Character: a
```



## I/O Multiple Values

I/O of multiple values is a common scenario in programming. In C, we can read or write multiple values using the same `scanf()` and `printf()` functions. Here's an example that demonstrates how to read and print multiple values using these functions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1, num2;
    float f;
    char c;
    
    // read multiple values using scanf()
    scanf("%d %f %c %d", &num1, &f, &c, &num2);
    
    // print multiple values using printf()
    printf("Integer 1: %d\n", num1);
    printf("Float: %f\n", f);
    printf("Character: %c\n", c);
    printf("Integer 2: %d\n", num2);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we read multiple values using a single `scanf()` function call. The format string `"%d %f %c %d"` specifies that we want to read an integer, a float, a character, and another integer. We pass the addresses of the variables where we want to store the values.

Similarly, we print multiple values using a single `printf()` function call. We use the `%` character to specify the placeholders for variables, and the format specifier follows the `%` character.

Here's an example of the input and output of this program:

### Input:

```zsh
10 3.14 a 20
```

### Output:

```zsh
Integer 1: 10
Float: 3.140000
Character: a
Integer 2: 20
```

now before moving on to the next tutorial let's learn about all the format specifiers in c language:

## Format Specifiers for I/O

Format specifiers are used in C programming to specify the format of the input or output. In the context of I/O, format specifiers are used with `scanf()` and `printf()` functions to read and print values of different data types.

Here are some of the common format specifiers for I/O in C:

-   `%d`: used to read or print an integer value.
-   `%f`: used to read or print a float value.
-   `%lf`: used to read or print a double value.
-   `%c`: used to read or print a character value.
-   `%s`: used to read or print a string value.
-   `%u`: used to read or print an unsigned integer value.
-   `%x` or `%X`: used to read or print a hexadecimal value.
-   `%o`: used to read or print an octal value.

For example, let's say we have an integer variable `num` with a value of 10, and we want to print its value to the console. We can use the `%d` format specifier with the `printf()` function like this:

```c
int num = 10;
printf("The value of num is %d", num);
```

```c
The value of num is 10
```

Similarly, if we want to read an integer value from the user, we can use the `%d` format specifier with the `scanf()` function like this:

```c
int num;
scanf("%d", &num);
```

In this example, we use the `%d` format specifier to tell `scanf()` to read an integer value from the user and store it in the `num` variable.

> Note that the format specifiers must match the data type of the variable you are reading or printing. If you use the wrong format specifier, the program may produce incorrect results or even crash.
