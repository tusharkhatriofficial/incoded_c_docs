# Keywords and Identifiers

Keywords and identifiers are the two fundamental building blocks of any programming language. In C programming language, keywords and identifiers are used to create meaningful and structured code.



## C Keywords

C Keywords are predefined words with a specific meaning and purpose. They cannot be used as identifiers in the program. Keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of the program. In C programming language, there are 32 keywords, which are listed below:

```c
auto    double  int     struct
break   else    long    switch
case    enum    register    typedef
char    extern  return  union
const   float   short   unsigned
continue    for     signed  void
default     goto    sizeof  volatile
do      if      static  while
```



## C Identifiers

Identifiers are user-defined names that are used to identify variables, functions, structures, and other program entities. In C programming language, an identifier can be a combination of letters, digits, and underscores. However, the first character of the identifier must be a letter or an underscore. Identifiers are case sensitive, which means "foo" and "Foo" are two different identifiers.

Here are some examples of valid identifiers in C programming language:

```C
int age;
float salary;
char first_name[20];
double balance;
```

### Rules for Creating Identifiers

To create an identifier in C programming language, follow these rules:

- The identifier can only contain letters, digits, and underscores.

- The first character of the identifier must be a letter or an underscore.

- The identifier cannot be a keyword.

- Identifiers are case sensitive, which means "foo" and "Foo" are two different identifiers.

You can choose any name as an identifier if you follow the above rule, however, give meaningful names to identifiers that make sense.



## Conclusion

C Keywords and Identifiers are essential building blocks of the C programming language. Keywords are predefined words with specific meanings, and identifiers are user-defined names used to identify variables, functions, and other program entities. It is essential to follow the rules for creating identifiers to avoid syntax errors in the program.
