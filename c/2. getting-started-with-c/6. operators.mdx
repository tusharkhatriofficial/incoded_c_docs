# Operators

Operators are an essential part of any programming language, including C. They are symbols that instruct the compiler to perform specific arithmetic or logical operations on the operands. C programming language provides a wide range of operators, which can be classified into different categories.



## Arithmetic Operators:

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical operands. The following are the arithmetic operators in C:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)

| Operator | Meaning of Operator                        |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| +        | addition or unary plus                     |
| -        | subtraction or unary minus                 |
| *        | multiplication                             |
| /        | division                                   |
| %        | remainder after division (modulo division) |


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   int a = 10, b = 5;
   
   printf("Addition: %d\n", a + b);
   printf("Subtraction: %d\n", a - b);
   printf("Multiplication: %d\n", a * b);
   printf("Division: %d\n", a / b);
   printf("Modulus: %d\n", a % b);
   
   return 0;
}
```

```zsh
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2
Modulus: 0
```


The operators `+`, `-` and `*` computes addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively as you might have expected.

The `/` operator will always return an integer value if both the operands are integers so if `a=9` and `b=5` the answer must be 1.8 but the compiler will return 1.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   int a = 9, b = 5;
   printf("Division: %d\n", a / b);
   return 0;
}
```

```zsh
Division: 1
```

The modulo operator `%` computes the remainder. When `a=10` is divided by `b=5`, the remainder is `0`. The `%` operator can only be used with integers.



## Increment and Decrement Operators

C language provides two unary operators known as increment and decrement operators, which can be used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. These operators are represented by "++" and "--" respectively. They are commonly used in loop constructs and expressions where the value of a variable needs to be incremented or decremented.


### Increment Operator (++)

The increment operator is used to increase the value of a variable by 1. It can be used in two ways: as a postfix operator or as a prefix operator.

- __Postfix Increment Operator__

  The postfix increment operator "++" increases the value of the variable after the expression is evaluated. It is used in the following way:

```c
int x = 5;
int y = x++;
```

  In this example, the value of `x` is first assigned to `y`, and then `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the value of `y` is 5, and the value of `x` is 6.
  
  - __Prefix Increment Operator__

  The prefix increment operator "++" increases the value of the variable before the expression is evaluated. It is used in the following way:

```c
int x = 5;
int y = ++x;
```

  In this example, `x` is incremented by 1, and then its value is assigned to `y`. Therefore, the value of `y` is 6, and the value of `x` is also 6.


### Decrement Operator (--)

The decrement operator is used to decrease the value of a variable by 1. It can also be used as a postfix operator or a prefix operator.

- __Postfix Decrement Operator__

  The postfix decrement operator "--" decreases the value of the variable after the expression is evaluated. It is used in the following way:
  
```c
int x = 5;
int y = x--;
```

  In this example, the value of `x` is first assigned to `y`, and then `x` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the value of `y` is 5, and the value of `x` is 4.

- __Prefix Decrement Operator__

  The prefix decrement operator "--" decreases the value of the variable before the expression is evaluated. It is used in the following way:

```c
int x = 5;
int y = --x;
```

In this example, `x` is decremented by 1, and then its value is assigned to `y`. Therefore, the value of `y` is 4, and the value of `x` is also 4.



## Assignment Operators:

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The following are the assignment operators in C:

-   Assignment (=)
-   Addition assignment (+=)
-   Subtraction assignment (-=)
-   Multiplication assignment (*=)
-   Division assignment (/=)
-   Modulus assignment (%=)

The assignment operator, denoted by the "=" symbol, is used to assign a value to a variable. The basic syntax of the assignment operator is:

```zsh
variable = value;
```

Here, the variable is the name of the variable to which the value will be assigned, and the value is the expression whose value will be assigned to the variable.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```c
int x = 10;
int y;
y = x;
```

In this code, the variable "x" is assigned the value of 10 using the initialization syntax. The variable "y" is declared without an initial value, and then the value of "x" is assigned to it using the assignment operator.

Another example:

```c
float a = 5.0;
float b = 2.0;
float c = a / b;
```

In this code, the variables "a" and "b" are initialized with the values 5.0 and 2.0, respectively. The expression "a / b" is evaluated and the resulting value is assigned to the variable "c" using the assignment operator.

> It is important to note that the assignment operator only assigns the value to the variable on the left-hand side of the operator. The expression on the right-hand side is evaluated first, and then the resulting value is assigned to the variable on the left-hand side.

The assignment operator can be combined with other operators to create compound assignment operators. For example, the following code is equivalent to "x = x + 5":

```c
x += 5;
```

The "+=" operator adds the value on the right-hand side to the value of the variable on the left-hand side, and then assigns the resulting value back to the variable on the left-hand side.

The blow given example contains all the assignment operators listed above:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 5;
    
    // Assignment
    int a = x;
    
    // Addition assignment
    int b = y;
    b += x;
    
    // Subtraction assignment
    int c = y;
    c -= x;
    
    // Multiplication assignment
    int d = y;
    d *= x;
    
    // Division assignment
    int e = x;
    e /= y;
    
    // Modulus assignment
    int f = x;
    f %= y;
    
    printf("a = %d\n", a);
    printf("b = %d\n", b);
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    printf("d = %d\n", d);
    printf("e = %d\n", e);
    printf("f = %d\n", f);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we initialize the variables "x" and "y" with the values 10 and 5, respectively. We then use each of the different types of assignment operators to perform operations on these variables and store the results in different variables ("a" through "f").

```zsh
a = 10
b = 15
c = -5
d = 50
e = 2
f = 0
```

As you can see, each assignment operator performs a different operation and produces a different result. The addition assignment adds the value on the right-hand side to the value of the variable on the left-hand side, the subtraction assignment subtracts the value on the right-hand side from the value of the variable on the left-hand side, and so on. The modulus assignment calculates the remainder when the variable on the left-hand side is divided by the value on the right-hand side.



## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false) based on the result of the comparison. There are six relational operators in C, which are listed below:

-   `==` (equal to)
-   `!=` (not equal to)
-   `<` (less than)
-   `>` (greater than)
-   `<=` (less than or equal to)
-   `>=` (greater than or equal to)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 7;

    printf("%d == %d is %d\n", a, b, a == b);
    printf("%d != %d is %d\n", a, b, a != b);
    printf("%d < %d is %d\n", a, b, a < b);
    printf("%d > %d is %d\n", a, b, a > b);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d\n", a, b, a <= b);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d\n", a, b, a >= b);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we declare two variables `a` and `b` with values of 5 and 7 respectively. We then use the relational operators to compare these values and print the results. The output of the program would be:

```zsh
5 == 7 is 0
5 != 7 is 1
5 < 7 is 1
5 > 7 is 0
5 <= 7 is 1
5 >= 7 is 0
```

We can see that `a == b` is false, `a != b` is true, `a < b` is true, `a > b` is false, `a <= b` is true, and `a >= b` is false. These results are determined by the values of `a` and `b` and the conditions specified by the relational operators.



## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple relational expressions to form more complex conditions in C. There are three logical operators in C: `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT).


- __AND__

The logical AND (`&&`) operator returns true if both the left and right operands are true. It returns false otherwise. For example, `x && y` would return true if both `x` and `y` are true.


- __OR__

The logical OR (`||`) operator returns true if either the left or right operand is true. It returns false only if both operands are false. For example, `x || y` would return true if either `x` or `y` (or both) are true.


- __NOT__

The logical NOT (`!`) operator is a unary operator that returns the opposite of its operand. It returns true if the operand is false and false if the operand is true. For example, `!x` would return true if `x` is false.

Here's an example program that demonstrates the use of logical operators:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 7;
    int z = 10;

    // Logical AND
    int result_and = (x > 0) && (y > 0);
    printf("Logical AND result: %d\n", result_and);

    // Logical OR
    int result_or = (x == 0) || (y == 0);
    printf("Logical OR result: %d\n", result_or);

    // Logical NOT
    int result_not = !(x == 0);
    printf("Logical NOT result: %d\n", result_not);

    return 0;
}
```

```zsh
Logical AND result: 1
Logical OR result: 0
Logical NOT result: 1
```

In the above example, we declare three variables `x`, `y`, and `z` with values of 5, 7, and 10 respectively. We then use the logical operators to combine relational expressions and print the results.

The first example uses the logical AND operator to check if both `x` and `y` are greater than zero. We store the result of the expression `(x > 0) && (y > 0)` in the variable `result_and` and print it out. Since both `x` and `y` are greater than zero, the result is true, which is represented by the value `1`.

The second example uses the logical OR operator to check if either `x` or `y` (or both) are equal to zero. We store the result of the expression `(x == 0) || (y == 0)` in the variable `result_or` and print it out. Since neither `x` nor `y` are equal to zero, the result is false, which is represented by the value `0`.

The third example uses the logical NOT operator to check if `x` is not equal to zero. We store the result of the expression `!(x == 0)` in the variable `result_not` and print it out. Since `x` is not equal to zero, the result is true, which is represented by the value `1`.



## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are operators that perform operations on individual bits of a number. These operators are useful when working with low-level programming or when performing specific operations on binary values. In C, there are six bitwise operators:

1.  Bitwise AND operator: `&`
2.  Bitwise OR operator: `|`
3.  Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator: `^`
4.  Bitwise complement (one's complement) operator: `~`
5.  Left shift operator: `<<`
6.  Right shift operator: `>>`

- __Bitwise AND (`&`)__: This operator performs a logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits in two integers. The resulting bit is set to 1 only if both bits are 1.

```c
int a = 5;     // Binary representation: 0101
int b = 3;     // Binary representation: 0011
int result = a & b;   // Binary representation: 0001 (1 in decimal)

printf("Result of AND operation: %d", result);
```

```zsh
Result of AND operation: 1
```

- __Bitwise OR (`|`)__: This operator performs a logical OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits in two integers. The resulting bit is set to 1 if either of the bits is 1.

```c
int a = 5;     // Binary representation: 0101
int b = 3;     // Binary representation: 0011
int result = a | b;   // Binary representation: 0111 (7 in decimal)

printf("Result of OR operation: %d", result);
```

```zsh
Result of OR operation: 7
```

- __Bitwise XOR (`^`)__: This operator performs a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits in two integers. The resulting bit is set to 1 only if one of the bits is 1 and the other is 0.

```c
int a = 5;     // Binary representation: 0101
int b = 3;     // Binary representation: 0011
int result = a ^ b;   // Binary representation: 0110 (6 in decimal)

printf("Result of XOR operation: %d", result);
```

```c
Result of XOR operation: 6
```

- __Bitwise NOT/Complement (`~`)__: This operator performs a unary operation on a single integer and flips all the bits. All 0 bits become 1, and all 1 bits become 0.

```c
int a = 5;     // Binary representation: 0101
int result = ~a;   // Binary representation: 1010 (-6 in decimal)

printf("Result of complement operation: %d", result);
```

```zsh
Result of complement operation: -6
```

- __Left Shift (`<<`)__: This operator shifts all the bits in an integer to the left by a specified number of bits. The shifted bits are filled with 0s.

```c
int a = 5;     // Binary representation: 0101
int result = a << 2;   // Binary representation: 010100 (20 in decimal)

printf("Result of left shift operation: %d", result);
```

```zsh
Result of left shift operation: 20
```

- __Right Shift (`>>`)__: This operator shifts all the bits in an integer to the right by a specified number of bits. The shifted bits are filled with 0s if the integer is unsigned, and with the sign bit if the integer is signed.

```c
int a = 5;     // Binary representation: 0101
int result = a >> 1;   // Binary representation: 0010 (2 in decimal)

printf("Result of right shift operation: %d", result);
```

```zsh
Result of right shift operation: 2
```



## The sizeof operator

The `sizeof` operator is used to determine the size of a variable or data type in bytes. It returns the size of its operand in bytes, which can be useful when allocating memory or working with data structures.

The `sizeof` operator is a unary operator, which means it operates on a single operand. The syntax for using `sizeof` is as follows:

```zsh
sizeof (operand)
```

The operand can be a variable, data type, or expression. Here are a few examples:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    char c = 'a';
    float f = 3.14;
    
    printf("Size of int: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(int));
    printf("Size of char: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(char));
    printf("Size of float: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(float));
    printf("Size of a: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(a));
    printf("Size of c: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(c));
    printf("Size of f: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(f));
    
    return 0;
}
```

```zsh
Size of int: 4 bytes
Size of char: 1 bytes
Size of float: 4 bytes
Size of a: 4 bytes
Size of c: 1 bytes
Size of f: 4 bytes
```

In the above example, the `sizeof` operator is used to determine the size of various data types, as well as the size of specific variables.

It is important to note that the size of a data type may vary depending on the platform and the compiler being used. Therefore, it is always a good practice to use the `sizeof` operator to ensure that you are allocating the correct amount of memory for your data.
