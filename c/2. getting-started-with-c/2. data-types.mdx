# Data Types

In C programming language, data types are used to define variables that can hold different kinds of data. As the name suggests, a Datatype defines the **type of data** being used. Whenever we define a variable or use any data in the C language program, we have to specify the type of the data, so that the compiler knows what type of data to expect. 

There are four main categories of data types in C as defined below:

- Basic data types
- Derived data types
- Enumeration data types
- Void data type



## Basic data types

The basic data types in C include:

- __int__: 

  This data type is used to store integer values (whole numbers). In the example given, the variable `age` has been assigned the value of 27, which is an integer value.
  
```c
int age = 20;
```

- __float__:

  This data type is used to store decimal values with single precision. The variable `price` has been assigned the value of 19.99, which is a decimal value.

```c
float price = 19.99;
```

- __double__: 

  This data type is used to store decimal values with double precision. The variable `pi` has been assigned the value of 3.14159265359, which is a decimal value with more precision than a float.

```c
double pi = 3.14159265359;
```

- __char__:

  This data type is used to store a single character. The variable `grade` has been assigned the character 'T'.

```c
char grade = 'T';
```

- __short__:

  This data type is used to store small integer values. The variable `num` has been assigned the value of 25182, which is a small integer value.

```c
short num = 25182;
```

> The `short` data type can store integer values from -32,768 to 32,767

- __long__:

  This data type is used to store large integer values. The variable `population` has been assigned the value of 7000000000, which is a large integer value.

```c
long population = 7000000000;
```

> On most systems, `long` is typically 32 bits or 64 bits in size, and can store integer values in the range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 for a 32-bit `long`, and from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 for a 64-bit `long`.



## Derived data types

Derived data types are those data types that are derived from the basic data types as discussed above. These data types are used to create complex data structures by combining basic data types together. 

Derived data types in C include:

- __Arrays__: used to store a collection of values of the same data type.

```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

- __Pointers__: used to store the memory addresses of variables.

```c
int *p;
```

- __Structures__: used to store a collection of variables of different data types under a single name.

```c
struct person {
   char name[50];
   int age;
   float salary;
} employee;
```

- __Unions__: used to store a collection of variables of different data types that share the same memory location.

```c
union data {
   int i;
   float f;
} value;
```



## Enumeration Data Types (enum):

Enumeration data types (also known as enums) are used to define a set of named constants. An enum consists of a list of identifiers (also known as enumerators) and their associated integer values. Enums provide a way to create named constants that can be more meaningful and easier to read than raw integer values.

Here's an example of declaring an enumeration:

```c
enum dayOfWeek {
   Monday,
   Tuesday,
   Wednesday,
   Thursday,
   Friday,
   Saturday,
   Sunday
};
```

In this example, an enum named `dayOfWeek` has been defined with seven enumerators that represent the days of the week. The first enumerator, `Monday`, has a value of 0 by default, and the subsequent enumerators have values that increment by one.

Enums can also be assigned specific integer values, like this:

```c
enum month {
    January = 1,
    February,
    March,
    April,
    May,
    June,
    July,
    August,
    September,
    October,
    November,
    December
};
```

In the above example, an enum named `month` has been defined with twelve enumerators that represent the months of the year. The first enumerator, `January`, has a value of 1, and the subsequent enumerators have values that increment by one.



## Void data type

The void data type in C is used to represent the absence of a type. It is commonly used as a return type for functions that do not return a value.

Here's an example of declaring a function that returns a void:

```c
void printHello() {
   printf("Hello World!");
}
```

We will learn about functions further in this series for now just understand that void simply means empty.
