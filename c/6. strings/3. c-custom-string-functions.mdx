# Custom String Functions in C: Examples and Implementation

## Overview

While C provides built-in string functions, you can also create custom string functions tailored to your specific needs. Custom string functions can be designed to perform tasks such as counting characters, searching for substrings, or converting case. This documentation explores the implementation of some custom string functions in C through examples.

## Counting Characters: countChars()

The `countChars()` function counts the occurrences of a specific character in a given string. It takes two arguments: the string and the character to count. Here's an example implementation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int countChars(const char *str, char ch) {
    int count = 0;

    while (*str != '\0') {
        if (*str == ch) {
            count++;
        }
        str++;
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    char message[] = "Hello, world!";
    char character = 'l';

    int count = countChars(message, character);

    printf("Count of '%c': %d\n", character, count);

    return 0;
}
```

```zsh
Count of 'l': 3
```

- In the above code, the `countChars()` function is implemented to count the occurrences of a character in a string.
- The function takes a pointer to the string (`const char *str`) and the character to count (`char ch`) as arguments.
- A counter variable `count` is initialized to 0.
- Using a `while` loop, the function iterates through each character of the string until it reaches the null character (`'\0'`).
- If the current character matches the character to count, the count is incremented.
- Finally, the count of occurrences is returned and printed in the `main()` function.

## Searching for Substrings: findSubstring()

The `findSubstring()` function searches for a substring within a given string. It takes two arguments: the string and the substring to search for. Here's an example implementation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int findSubstring(const char *str, const char *substr) {
    int i, j;

    for (i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        j = 0;

        while (str[i + j] == substr[j]) {
            if (substr[j] == '\0') {
                return i;
            }
            j++;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

int main() {
    char message[] = "Hello, world!";
    char substring[] = "world";

    int index = findSubstring(message, substring);

    if (index != -1) {
        printf("Substring '%s' found at index %d\n", substring, index);
    } else {
        printf("Substring '%s' not found\n", substring);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

```zsh
Substring 'world' found at index 7
```

- In the above code, the `findSubstring()` function is implemented to search for a substring within a string.
- The function takes two pointers to the strings (`const char *str` and `const char *substr`) as arguments.
- Two index variables `i` and `j` are declared.
- Using a nested `for` loop and a `while` loop, the function compares each character of the string with the substring.
- If the characters match up to the end of the substring (i.e., the null character), the function returns the index at which the substring is found.
- If the substring is not found, the function returns -1.
- The result is printed in the `main()` function.

## Converting Case: convertCase()

The `convertCase()` function converts the case of letters in a given string. It takes a string as an argument and modifies it in-place. Here's an example implementation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void convertCase(char *str) {
    while (*str != '\0') {
        if (*str >= 'a' && *str <= 'z') {
            *str = *str - 32;  // Convert to uppercase
        } else if (*str >= 'A' && *str <= 'Z') {
            *str = *str + 32;  // Convert to lowercase
        }
        str++;
    }
}

int main() {
    char message[] = "Hello, World!";

    convertCase(message);

    printf("Converted: %s\n", message);

    return 0;
}
```

```zsh
Converted: hELLO, wORLD!
```

- In the above code, the `convertCase()` function is implemented to convert the case of letters in a string.
- The function takes a pointer to the string (`char *str`) as an argument.
- Using a `while` loop, the function iterates through each character of the string until it reaches the null character (`'\0'`).
- If the character is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value.
- If the character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value.
- The string is modified in-place.
- The converted string is printed in the `main()` function.

By creating custom functions, you can tailor string manipulation operations to suit your specific requirements. Examples of counting characters, searching for substrings, and converting case were provided to demonstrate the implementation of these custom functions. Custom string functions can enhance the functionality of your C programs and make string manipulation tasks more efficient and convenient.
