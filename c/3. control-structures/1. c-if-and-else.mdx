# if and else in C

From here, the real coding part begins. Gear up to travel to the next part of coding. This will be a lot of fun.

Many times, we need to first see the condition and then make a decision.  
As an example, consider that a chocolate costs 10 rupees. So, if you have 10 rupees or more, you can buy the chocolate.

But how do we represent this scenario in C? This type of decision taking is done by using **if** statement in C.



## The if Statement

The if statement is used to test a condition and execute a block of code if the condition is true. The syntax of the if statement is as follows:

```c
if (condition)
{
   //code to be executed if condition is true
}
```

### How if statement works?

The `if` statement evaluates the test expression inside the parenthesis `()`.

- If the test expression is evaluated to true, statements inside the body of `if` are executed.
- If the test expression is evaluated to false, statements inside the body of `if` are not executed.

__Example:__

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
   int num = 10;

   if (num > 0)
   {
      printf("%d is a positive number\n", num);
   }

   return 0;
}
```

In this example, the if statement checks if the value of the variable num is greater than 0. Since num has the value of 10, which is greater than 0, the code inside the if block is executed and the output will be:

```zsh
10 is a positive number
```



## The if-else Statement

The if-else statement is used to test a condition and execute a block of code if the condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. The syntax of the if-else statement is as follows:

```c
if (condition)
{
   //code to be executed if condition is true
}
else
{
   //code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

Here, "condition" is an expression that is evaluated to either true or false. If the condition is true, then the code inside the if block will be executed, otherwise, the code inside the else block will be executed.

**Example:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
   int num = 0;

   if (num > 0)
   {
      printf("%d is a positive number\n", num);
   }
   else
   {
      printf("%d is not a positive number\n", num);
   }

   return 0;
}
```

In this example, the if-else statement checks if the value of the variable num is greater than 0. Since num has the value of 0, which is not greater than 0, the code inside the else block is executed and the output will be "0 is not a positive number".



## Nested if-else Statements

Nested if-else statements are used to test multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on those conditions. The syntax of the nested if-else statement is as follows:

```c
if (condition1)
{
   //code to be executed if condition1 is true

   if (condition2)
   {
      //code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are true
   }
   else
   {
      //code to be executed if condition1 is true but condition2 is false
   }
}
else
{
   //code to be executed if condition1 is false
}
```

Here, "condition1" and "condition2" are expressions that are evaluated to either true or false. If condition1 is true, then the code inside the first if block will be executed. If condition2 is also true, then the code inside the nested if block will be executed, otherwise, the code inside the nested else block will be executed. If condition1 is false, then the code inside the else block will be executed.

**Example:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
   int num1 = 10, num2 = 20;

   if (num1 > 0)
   {
      printf("%d is a positive number\n", num1);

      if (num2 > 0)
      {
         printf("%d is also a positive number\n", num2);
      }
      else
      {
         printf("%d is not a positive number\n", num2);
      }
   }
   else
   {
      printf("%d is not a positive number\n", num1);
   }

   return 0;
}
```

The nested if-else statement first checks if the value of the variable num1 is greater than 0. Since num1 has the value of 10, which is greater than 0, the code inside the first if block is executed. Then, the nested if-else statement checks if the value of the variable num2 is greater than 0. Since num2 has the value of 20, which is also greater than 0, the code inside the nested if block is executed and the output will be "10 is a positive number" and "20 is also a positive number".



## C if...else Ladder

The `if...else` statement executes two different codes depending upon whether the test expression is true or false. Sometimes, a choice has to be made from more than 2 possibilities and here comes `else if` in play.

The else if statement is another type of conditional statement in C that allows you to check for multiple conditions in a single if-else statement.

The syntax for the else if statement is:

```c
if (condition1)
{
   // code to execute if condition1 is true
}
else if (condition2)
{
   // code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
}
else if (condition3)
{
   // code to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
}
...
else
{
   // code to execute if all the conditions are false
}
```

Here, the conditions are checked in order, and the first condition that is true executes the corresponding code block. If none of the conditions are true, the code in the else block is executed.

Let's take a look at an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
   int num = 10;

   if (num > 0)
   {
      printf("%d is a positive number\n", num);
   }
   else if (num == 0)
   {
      printf("%d is zero\n", num);
   }
   else
   {
      printf("%d is a negative number\n", num);
   }

   return 0;
}
```

In the above example, the if statement first checks if the value of the variable num is greater than 0. Since num has the value of 10, which is greater than 0, the code inside the if block is executed and the output will be "10 is a positive number". If the value of num was 0, then the else if block would be executed and the output would be "0 is zero". Finally, if the value of num was negative, the else block would be executed and the output would be "num is a negative number".

In summary, the else if statement is used when you need to check for multiple conditions in a single if-else statement, and it can be useful for writing more efficient and concise code.
